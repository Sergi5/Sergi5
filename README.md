### About me

My name is Sergii Iakunin. Currently I'm living in Poland, came here from Ukraine in 2015. 
Last few years I worked in Transport sector and made way from Junior Dispatcher to Chief of Transport Department. Some time ago, I decided to change my career direction into Software Testing, so I made QA Course and since that time continuously keep learning and working on uTest, keep increasing my skills.
My natural curiosity constantly pushes me to self-development. I have always been interested in different technologies, how things work, as well as my old passion for mind games, detective stories, thrillers, solving brain-teasers, puzzles and finally I can turn my hobbies into a favorite job. I like to analyze and look for inaccuracies, mistakes, illogicalities, so I feel comfortable in Tester's role.
My goal is to keep developing testing knowledges and technical skills.
